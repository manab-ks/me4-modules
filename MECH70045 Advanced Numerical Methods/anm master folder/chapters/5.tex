Numerical methods for boundary value problems and initial values problems. Spatial discretisation methods will encompass finite difference (FD), finite volume (FV), finite element (FE), spectral element (SE) and isogeometric analysis (IGA) methods for elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs. Emphasis will be placed upon the relationship between the different methods using the genera weighted residual method for general elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs (e.g., point collocation, subdomain collocation, Bubnov-Galerkin, Petrov-Galerkin, discontinuous Galerkin schemes) and how they are related to variational schemes for certain classes of PDEs such as elliptic PDEs.  Also discussed will be the properties of the schemes (e.g., convergence, consistency, stability and verification and validation using techniques such as the method of manufactured solutions). Examples will be taken from heat transfer, radiation transport and fluid mechanics. Initial value PDE problems will use theta time-discretisation methods (i.e., Euler and Crank-Nicholson).
