\chapter{Ordinary Differential Equations}
Review of numerical methods for boundary value and initial value problems (e.g., Euler methods, Runge-Kutta, stiff ODES, systems of ODEs). There will be a focus on applications of the methods to practical problems involving coupled systems of ODES. This differentiates from the second-year course due to the focus on practical problems.
