\chapter{Linear Algebra and Algebraic Matrix Solvers}
Review of linear algebra, direct and iterative matrix solution algorithms including eigenvalue solvers (e.g., power iteration). This will focus on both symmetric and non-symmetric methods as well as storage schemes (e.g., compressed row storage â€“ CRS, compressed column storage, block storage etc). Methods will encompass conjugate gradient (CG) solvers, bi-conjugate gradient (BCG), pre-conditioners (e.g., Gauss-Seidel, SSOR, ILU, multigrid) and Krylov subspace methods for non-symmetric solvers (e.g., GMRES).
